# Django-React UI Prototype
This prototype model is a Django Project that has a React.js front-end that helps govern components. 


## Installation
First, it is important to install Python (at least version 3.10.7). 

Next, download the repo, which is a python virtual environment that should work on at least Windows 10. 

## Running The Server
Then, open command line and then go to the directory using `cd /d $PROTOTYPE_PATH$`, where you replace `$PROTOTYPE_PATH$` with the full path string, which you can get by clicking the project folder and clicking "Copy Path" under the "Home" tab in the file explorer. 

Then, you run `cd \Scripts` which should take you the correct directory.

After that, run `activate.bat`, which should start up the virtual environment

Now, to run the server, all you have to do is run `py manage.py runserver`.
